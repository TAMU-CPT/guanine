# GUANINE [![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/tamu_cpt/guanine-backend/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/tamu_cpt/guanine-backend)

System to store results of "quizzes" and other assessments. This component is
not galaxy specific (nor is the frontend), but we use it with a
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) server, hence the name.

Recommended to use with our GUANINE [frontend](https://github.com/TAMU-CPT/guanine-frontend/)
